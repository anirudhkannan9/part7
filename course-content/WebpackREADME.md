# Webpack

Create-react-app is as a 'black box' that makes React apps work. Let's look at a key tool in aiding this process: webpack.

## Bundling

We write our code in modules to make it easy to read, write, and maintain. (Old) browsers don't know how to interact with modular code, so we must bundle it into one file. 

Bundling serves several purposes:
- Allow the browser to read and execute our code
- Improve performance by cutting down on overhead that might arise from needing to import/use several files concurrently
- Give the browser a 'starting point' (typically *index.js*) from which to execute our code
